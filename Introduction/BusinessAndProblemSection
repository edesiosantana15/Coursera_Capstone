INTRODUCTION/BUSINESS PROBLEM

Opening a new business is not easy especially in a highly competitive city like New York,one of
the most visited cities in the world. Every businessman knows he should study his market before doing anything to check if there
is a gap and how his product will fill this gap. That is where Foursquare API can help, it is a tool to study the market study. 

The business problem of my study is someone would like to open a new restaurant in New York but he is not sure where to open it.
So, What are the best suburbs to open a restaurant in New York?
